# prince
The Prince lightweight block cipher in Verilog.

## Status
Not completed. Do. Not. Use.

The core simulated correctly, but has not yet been implemented in real
hardware.


## Introduction
[Prince](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/529.pdf) is a lightweight, low
latency block cipher suitable for Iot and embedded systems. The key is
128 bits and the block size is 64 bits.


## Implementation
The implementation focus is on size and will have iterative rounds.
